## Assignments with Dots
- primitive values are: string, numbers, bool, undefined, null
- Array are objects, the only difference is that array has methods.
## brackets notation
- We use bracket notation when we can't use string properties

## Destructuring array
- const [target] = [the source]
- const {target} = {the source}
