## Assignments with Dots
- primitive values are: string, numbers, bool, undefined, null
- Array are objects, the only difference is that array has methods.
## brackets notation
- We use bracket notation when we can't use string properties

## Destructuring array
- const [target] = [the source]
- const {target} = {the source}

## Loops
- Arrays work well with for loops because we have the numerical indices.
- Objects work better with for in loop because we say key in obj, that one.


##  FUNCTIONS IN DEPTH
- A function has parameters(variables)
- When you invoke a function you'll send argumentssssss

## High Order Functions
- Takes a function as an input (arguments)
- Returns a function as the output.

## IMPORTANT
- _.map always return an array with the same length.
- _.each doesn't return anything.
- _.filter return based on that truthy test that we pass it.
- _.reduce always return one function.

## FUNCTIONAL UTILITIES
- Currying and Composing
- Currying is when you create a function that can later be called multiple times with different arguments.
- Composing is when you take two functions and combine them essenntially.

## Closures
- It's when a function is inside of a function that creates.
- Scope isolation.
- A closure happens when you put two function inside of a function and you could take advantage of that by returning a function that retains access to it's parent function even after it has been executed (Bianca Trainner)
